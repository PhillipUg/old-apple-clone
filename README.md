In this project, my aim here was to try and replicate the gradient and background features of this page.

There are some elements on this page which are produced with Javascript but my objective in this project wasn't to give this page functionality.

## Built with
  * HTML
  * CSS

## Live demo

## Getting started

**For this project, you’ll try your best to recreate this old apple web page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the real page, so functionality is not a priority.**

Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the real page and understand how elements are placed and styled. 
Build your own page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.
  - First setup a github repository for your project.
  - Then create a .html file where all your HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all your styling code will reside
  - Then open the youtube web page, inspect its features with your browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
